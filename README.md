   Hi, I'm Caymen!

  <h3>Actively looking for an engineering position with a great company!</h3>
  <h4>A little about me?</h4>
<p> 📍 Nashville, TN (Open To Relocation) <br> 🎓 WGU Alumn, B.S. Software Engineering. </p>
<p>
Curious learner. Always Googling something, most recently how many of an octopuses' tentacles  are its arms vs. its legs? (Answer: 6 arms, 2 legs. 🤯) My professional experience has always been within ops, but have always actively researched and tinkered with software in my free time. I finally decided to make the change to pursue my passion within software engineering and completed my software engineering degree. I am interested in new technologies and have a passion for mastering my craft. I commit to always learning and never being content with my knowledge.
</p>
<p>My primary language(s) are Java, Kotlin, and JavaScript. I have knowledge of ReactJS, Redux, Android Development, JavaFX, Java desktop applications using JavaFX and jPackage to compile executable applications, SQL, MongoDB, Room, and Postgres.</p>
<p>☁️ I have experience with deploying and working within AWS, S3, DigitalOcean, and (limited) Azure cloud solutions. </p>
